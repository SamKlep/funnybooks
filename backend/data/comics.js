Later, this thug returns to his boss, the mobster known as Morgan to tell him that the Vulture is operating out of a fix-it shop. Morgan finds this amusing given the defeats of both Kingpin and Hammerhead have left a power vacuum in the underworld. Morgan decides to try and make allies with the Vulture so his gang can expand out of Harlem and take over the entire underworld.",
